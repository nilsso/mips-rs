mips-state ðŸš€
=============

The Stationeers IC10 state and simulator component of `mips-rs`.

Additionally includes:
- [mips-simulator-cli](tools/mips-simulator-cli)
    the state and simulator implemented as a CLI program
- [stationeering-to-ron](tools/stationeering-to-ron)
    a tool to pull logic devices from a [stationeering.com][stationeering] downloaded `things.json`
    file

A new simulator state can be constructed via `ICState::default` for one with
(per how IC10 chips are in Stationeers):
- 18 memory registers,
- 6 device registers, and
- aliases `sp` and `ra` for memory registers 16 and 17 respectively.

They can also be constructed manually via `ICState::new` by providing `mem_size` the number of
memory registers and `dev_size` the number of device registers. A few helper-builder methods exist
for setting the state memory register values (`with_mem`), state devices (`with_dev`) and aliases
(`with_alias`) at the call site.

Note that internally the `sp` and `ra` *registers* are always `mem_size-2` and `mem_size-1`
respectively; that is, internal functions which modify `sp` will always modify the `mem_size-1`-th
register and likewise the `mem_size-2`-th register for `ra`, regardless of how the `sp` and `ra`
*aliases* are set.
