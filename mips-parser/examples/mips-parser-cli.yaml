about: "Parse Stationeer MIPS source code.
        Each line is output as either:\n
        - a parsing expression grammar pair (`output=peg`)\n
        - an abstract syntax tree           (`output=ast`)\n
        - MIPS code from constructed AST    (`output=mips`)\n
        (One is required, but only one is allowed)\n
        \n
        Parse a file with `--file <file>`, or each line from stdin\n
        (if stdin is not streamed, send EOF via Ctrl-D to terminate)"
