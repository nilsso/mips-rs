mips-parser ðŸš€
==============

The MIPS language parser component of `mips-rs`.

## Todo and notes

- [x] Change all nodes errors to have strings
- [ ] Because `Program::try_from_*` ommits any blank lines, literal jump targets will be wrong
    without later padding out the lines once more (as is what `mips-simulator` does).
    Come up with a way to adjust these  literal jump targets.

On stationeering:
- labels and aliases of same name do not play well together
- later labels and aliases seem to nullify even prior definitions

## Abstract syntax tree

From [Wikipedia][wiki-ast]:

> In computer science, an abstract syntax tree (AST), or just syntax tree, is a tree representation
> of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node of
> the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. 

[wiki-ast]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree

This parser uses [Pest] to generate a list of [parsing grammar pairs (PEGs)][peg] that are then
assembled into an AST. The simple schema looks like this, though it (currently) lacks nodes for
branching:

[pest]: https://pest.rs/
[peg]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar

```
Program(Vec<(usize, Expr)>)  "expressions with corresponding line numbers"
â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
â”‚
â””â”€ Expr(Func, Vec<Arg>)  "an expression (the function kind and its arguments)"
â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Arg::ArgMem(Mem)
â”‚               â”œâ”€ Mem::MemAlias(String)      "an alias to a register, e.g. x"
â”‚               â””â”€ Mem::MemLit(usize, usize)  "a register, e.g. r4 ~ MemLit(4, 0)"
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Arg::ArgDev(Dev)
â”‚               â”œâ”€ Dev::DevAlias(String)      "an alias to a device, e.g. y"
â”‚               â””â”€ Dev::DevLit(usize, usize)  "a device, e.g. dr5 ~ MemLit(5, 1)"
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Arg::ArgVal(Val)
â”‚               â”œ Val::ValLit(f64)  "a literal f64 value"
â”‚               â”” Val::ValMem(Mem)  "a value stored in memory"
â”‚
â””â”€ Arg::ArgToken(String)  "a single string token"
```

This tree can then be used in tandem with the state simulator module to simulate a
functioning Stationeers IC10 chip.

## Nodes of the tree *(warning - needs to be updated)*

The tree is constructed out of the following nodes:

### Program
A [`Program`] node represents an entire MIPS program
and contains a vector of [expressions](#expressions) and their line numbers.

### Expressions
Expressions in MIPS are either a label or a function call;
an [`Expr`] node represents one of these.

* [`Expr::ExprLabel`] - simply contains the `String` of the label
* [`Expr::ExprFunc`] - contains the [function identifier](#functions) 
    and a vector of [arguments](#arguments)

### Functions
A [`Function`] node refers simply to a MIPS function.
It enumerates all the functions available in Stationeers MIPS.

### Arguments
Arguments to MIPS functions can be memory registers, device registers,
numeric values or simple string tokens;
an [`Arg`] node represents one of these.

* [`Arg::ArgMem`] - contains a [memory register](#memory) node
* [`Arg::ArgDev`] - contains a [device register](#device) node
* [`Arg::ArgVal`] - contains a [numeric value](#value) node
* [`Arg::ArgToken`] - contains a string token.

Important to note is that arguments being valid for a particular function is enforced
not by the AST construction but by the Pest parser.

### Memory
A memory register node ([`Memory`]) refers to a value stored in memory
and can be direct, an alias, or indirect

* [`Memory::MemBase`] - a memory register indexed directly by a numeric value
* [`Memory::MemAlias`] - an (unvalidated) alias to a memory register
* [`Memory::Mem`] - a memory register indexed by a value in memory (indrectly)

Examples:

<table>
    <tr><th>MIPS</th><th>AST Analog</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>"r0"</code></td>
        <td><code>Memory::MemBase</code></td>
        <td>
            Refers to the memory register indexed by zero; that is, the first (0th)
            memory register.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>"x"</code></td>
        <td><code>Memory::MemAlias</code></td>
        <td>
            Refers to a memory register aliased by the string <code>"x"</code>
            (if such an alias was defined).
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>"rr1"</code></td>
        <td><code>Memory::Mem</code></td>
        <td>
            Refers to the memory register indexed by the value at
            memory register <code>"r1"</code>.</br>
            Suppose <code>"r1"</code> stores 5.
            Then <code>"rr1"</code> reduces to <code>"r5"</code>.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Note that a `Memory::MemAlias` cannot be used within a `Memory::Mem` as indirection
via aliases is not part of the MIPS syntax.

### Device
A device register node ([`Device`]) can also be direct, an alias, or indirect, but refer to a
connected input-output (IO) device.

* [`Device::DevBase`] - a device register indexed directly by a numeric value
* [`Device::DevAlias`] - an (unvalidated) alias to a device register
* [`Device::Dev`] - a device register indexed by a value in memory (indrectly)

(See the above examples for `Memory`.)

Note that a device register cannot be index indirectly via device registers since device
registers do not store a numeric value but instead a connection to an IO device.
For example:

* `"dr2"` is fine, and refers to
    the device indexed by the value stored at memory register `"r2"`, but
* `"dd2"` means nothing, because `"d2"` refers to the 3rd device and not a number.

### Value
A value argument in MIPS can be a literal numeric value or one stored in memory;
a [`Value`] node represents one of these.

* [`Value::ValLit`] - a literal floating-point value
* [`Value::ValMem`] - a value stored in memory indexed via a [`Memory`] register
