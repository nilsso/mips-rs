Stationeers MIPS, but in Rust ðŸš€
=============================

A Stationeers MIPS parser and simulator written an Rust,
with aspirations of being a translation tool from MIPS supersets into MIPS.

MIPS is a reduced instruct set computer (RISC) assembly language that was addapted into the
official in-game scripting language of the [Stationeers] game by [Rocketwerkz].
The full instruction set can be found and tested at [stationeering.com].

This project is divided into a few parts:
* [`mips-parser`][parser] - the MIPS parser itself
* [`mips-state`][state] - the Stationeers [Integrated Circuit (IC10)][ic10] simulator
